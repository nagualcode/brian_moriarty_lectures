## What is this repository?  

This is a **backup archive** of lectures, presentations, and writings by the game designer and storyteller **Brian Moriarty** (of *Loom*, *Trinity* and *Beyond Zork* fame).  

Since websites vanish faster than biscuits at a tea party, this repository exists to ensure that Moriarty’s wit, insights, and philosophical musings on games, art, and meaning are preserved in one place.  

Think of it less as a backup, and more as a **digital teapot**: sturdy, reliable, and slightly eccentric, but always ready to serve up something warm for the mind.

## Why should you care?  

Because game design isn’t just about pixels and polygons.  
It’s about stories, culture, memory, and—occasionally—moon-eating celestial bodies.  

This archive gives students, researchers, and nostalgic wanderers a chance to sip from Moriarty’s well of ideas without worrying about 404 errors.

## Disclaimer  

This is a **non-official backup**. No profit, no fuss, no ads for dubious VPN services. Just preservation.  
If Brian Moriarty (or his representatives) would like it removed, I shall comply—albeit with a stiff upper lip and a resigned sigh.

Put the kettle on, pick a lecture, and enjoy.  

Cheers,
